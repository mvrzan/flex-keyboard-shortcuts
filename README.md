## What does it do?

The _Keyboard Shortcuts Manager_ Twilio Flex plugin empowers contact center users to configure default and custom keyboards shortcuts in their day-to-day activities to increase efficiency and enjoyment when using Twilio Flex.

## How does this work?

With the release of Flex 2.1, Flex now supports keyboards shortcuts for the most common actions performed by agents. The official documentation can be found [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/end-user-guide/keyboard-shortcuts).

The 2.1 Flex UI exposes various APIs to interact with the default keyboard shortcuts, as well as adding custom ones. The official documentation can be found [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/ui/modify-keyboard-shortcuts).

The plugin is available to both agents and supervisors alike and it allows the following functionalities:

**View default Flex keyboard shortcuts:**

This view allows users to see the default Flex keyboard shortcuts and their current mappings.

**View custom Flex keyboard shortcuts**

<img width="100%" src="./screenshots/custom-keyboard-shortcuts.png"/>

This view allows users to see custom added keyboard shortcuts and their current mappings.

**A settings screen for easy management**

### How are you persisting changes between refreshes?

User modification to both default and custom keyboard shortcuts are stored into browser local storage and read during plugin initialization.

### Default keyboard shortcuts

### Custom keyboard shortcuts

### Supported Flex version

This plugin only supports Twilio Flex 2.1 and above because support for keyboard shortcuts has been introduced with Flex 2.1.

## Development

Run `twilio flex:plugins --help` to see all the commands we currently support. For further details on Flex Plugins refer to our documentation on the [Twilio Docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/plugins/cli) page.

# Configuration

## Requirements

To deploy this plugin, you will need:

- An active Twilio account with Flex provisioned. Refer to the [Flex Quickstart](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/quickstart/flex-basics#sign-up-for-or-sign-in-to-twilio-and-create-a-new-flex-project%22) to create one.
- Flex version 2.1 or above
- npm version 5.0.0 or later installed (type `npm -v` in your terminal to check)
- Node.js version 12 or later installed (type `node -v` in your terminal to check). _Even_ versions of Node are. **Note:** In order to install Twilio Flex CLI plugin that is needed for locally running Flex, Node version 16 is the latest supported version (if you are using Node 18., please revert back or use Node Version Manager).
- [Twilio CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart#install-twilio-cli) along with the [Flex CLI Plugin](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/plugins#available-plugins)
- Once the Twilio CLI and Twilio Flex CLI plugins are successfully installed, configure your [Twilio CLI profile](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/general-usage). **Note:** This step is required if you are running Twilio CLI for the first time or if you have multiple Twilio CLI profiles configured.

## Setup

Install the dependencies by running `npm install`:

```bash
cd flex-keyboard-shortcuts
npm install
```

From the root directory, rename `public/appConfig.example.js` to `public/appConfig.js`.

```bash
mv public/appConfig.example.js public/appConfig.js
```

## Flex Plugin

### Development

To run the plugin locally, you can use the Twilio Flex CLI plugin. Using your command line, run the following from the root directory of the plugin.

```bash
cd flex-keyboard-shortcuts
twilio flex:plugins:start
```

This will automatically start up the webpack dev server and open the browser for you. Your app will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

When you make changes to your code, the browser window will be automatically refreshed.

### Deploy your Flex Plugin

Once you are happy with your Flex plugin, you have to deploy then release it on your Flex application.

Run the following command to start the deployment:

```bash
twilio flex:plugins:deploy --major --changelog "Releasing Keyboard Shortcuts Manager" --description "Keyboard Shortcuts Manager"
```

After running the suggested next step, navigate to the [Plugins Dashboard](https://flex.twilio.com/admin/) to review your recently deployed plugin and confirm that itâ€™s enabled for your contact center.

**Note:** Common packages like `React`, `ReactDOM`, `Redux` and `ReactRedux` are not bundled with the build because they are treated as external dependencies so the plugin will depend on Flex to provide them globally.

You are all set to test this plugin on your Flex application!
